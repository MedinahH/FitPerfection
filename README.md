# FitPerfection
The objective of this software development project is to create a program that utilizes body scan technology and fabric properties to improve the fit of garments. The program will provide accurate body measurements and create patterns that can be used to produce garments that fit more comfortably and effectively.
The primary business objective of this project is to enhance customer satisfaction by reducing the number of returns due to poorly fitting garments. The software program will enable garment manufacturers to provide a more personalized and accurate fit for their customers, resulting in increased customer loyalty and retention.
Another important objective of this project is to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs associated with returns and exchanges. By using body scan technology and fabric properties, the software program will assist technical designers in providing them more body measurements in reduced time as well as an account for the properties of the fabric the garment will be sampled in. This will reduce the time it takes to measure models multiple times and automatically account for the stretch and unique properties of each garment used in production.
